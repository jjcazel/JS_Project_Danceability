# Welcome to Danceability!

## Background and Overview
This is a data visualization tool that will allow you to login to your Spotify account, get your top 50 tracks and see their danceability (and energy) factor. You will see the most danceable songs and their rank according to what you listen to most.

The motivation for this project was to do something that was music related and uses Spotify's API. I wanted to learn how to use popular APIs and display data using the d3.js library as well as HTML. Check out the live site [here](https://danceability1.herokuapp.com/)


## Functionality and MVP Features
* JavaScipt for functionality
* CSS for styling and visuals
* Spotify API and Spotify WebApi
* HTML
* Node.js server and Express.js RESTful Routes
* D3 data visualization libray

## MVPs
* Be able to log into a user's Spotify account.
* Be able to communicate with Spotify API to render the danceability factor (and other track    attributes and info) of any song in their library.
* Use D3.js library to build the graph, plot the data points, and render info in tooltips.
* Style with CSS and HTML.
